## Overview
This project aims to create a control system for a carbonated drinks production line. The system is designed to efficiently and consistently produce carbonated water by infusing water with carbon dioxide gas, resulting in a fizzy texture. The control system is implemented using a chip programmed to manage the production process.

## Main Idea
The main idea of the carbonated drinks production line is to follow a sequence of steps to produce carbonated water. These steps include adding ingredients, mixing, carbonation, bottling, labeling, packaging, and repeating the process for continuous production. The control chip manages these steps to ensure the production of high-quality carbonated drinks.

## Sequence and Steps
1. **Start**: All valves are closed.
2. **Adding Ingredients**: Water, sweeteners, flavors, and additives are added sequentially.
3. **Ingredients Mixing**: The ingredients are mixed and blended.
4. **Carbonation**: Carbon dioxide is introduced to create fizziness.
5. **Bottling**: The mixture is transferred into bottles and sealed.
6. **Labeling**: Labels with product information and branding are applied to the bottles.
7. **Packaging**: Bottles are packaged for distribution.
8. **Finished Product**: The final product is ready for distribution and consumption.
9. **Work Forever**: The production process repeats if the automatic mode is set.
10. **End**: The end of the production process.
